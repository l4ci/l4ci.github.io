    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <p>
      <a href="https://github.com">Github</a> recently announcend, that they now support PSD image viewing and diffing. It wasn´t possible to see and track changes to <code>.psd</code> files on github - but not it is. Awesome.

      Google <em>(I wont link to google for obvious reasons: if you dont know what google is or where to find it... google it!)</em> blogged about their recent addition to the google search crawler. It now understands javascript and css. That should change a lot for (so called) SEO experts. They are going to update the <a href="https://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/home?pli=1">Webmaster Tools</a> shortly, so it´s easy for us to get behind that process.

    <h2>Links</h2>
    <p>
      Links to various interesting / creative / new stuff on the web I came across this month.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>101 essential free fonts for web designers</strong> - <a href="http://www.webdesignerdepot.com/2014/05/101-essential-free-fonts-for-web-designers/">webdesignerdepot.com</a>
          <br> I normally don´t read post that seem that start with "Best 100" or "Top 10" - but this one was quite useful and interesting for anyone using typographie. So basically anyone in the webdesign industrie.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Basehold.it</strong> - <a href="http://basehold.it/">basehold.it</a>
          <br>Baseline grids are super helpful for web designers, allowing us to maintain vertical rhythm on our designs. But short of a few Javascript bookmarklets, there isnt really a simple way to get a baseline grid overlay on our designs. Until now!
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>FitText</strong> - <a href="http://fittextjs.com/">fittextjs.com</a>
          <br>FitText makes font-sizes flexible. Use this plugin on your fluid or responsive layout to achieve scalable headlines that fill the width of a parent element.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>ColorFinder</strong> - <a href="http://pieroxy.net/blog/pages/color-finder/index.html">pieroxy.net/blog/pages/color-finder/</a>
          <br>You need the most prominent color in an image? ColorFinder might come in handy!
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Underscores</strong> - <a href="http://underscores.me/">underscores.me</a>
          <br>Underscores makes creating wordpress themes from scratch easy. Well commented, modern, HTML5 templates. 404 templates and much more.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      As always I hope you might find some of them useful. Enjoy the sun and take care!
