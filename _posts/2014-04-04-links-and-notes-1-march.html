    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <p>
      Hey there, unfortunately I didn't find any time to blog lately. Which is a good sign in one way, because it means I'm busy with work for different projects. But nevertheless I would love to write more. This post should evolve to a habit of posting small updates (that are too long for a <a href="https://twitter.com/{{site.me.twitter}}">tweet</a>) and interesting links I stumbled upon. So here are my notes and links for march.
    </p>

    <h2>Links</h2>
    <p>
      Links to various interesting / creative / new stuff on the web I came across last month.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Uinames.com</strong> - <a href="http://uinames.com/">uinames.com</a>
          <br>If you need realistic sounding names for designing a user profile page or some sort of timeline.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Uifaces.com</strong> - <a href="http://uifaces.com/">uifaces.com</a>
          <br>If you need realistic photos you can use in mockups and even show to your client. No more fake model photos or empty faces.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Responsive Table</strong> - <a href="http://codepen.io/geoffyuen/pen/FCBEg">codepen.io/geoffyuen/pen/FCBEg</a>
          <br>We are used to design everything responsive nowadays - there are only a few things missing: responsive images and tables. This codepen shows an interesting method for making a table usable on small screen sizes.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Gibson Font</strong> - <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/canadatype/gibson/">myfonts.com/fonts/canadatype/gibson</a>
          <br>A nice sans serif typeface, that could be an alternative to some of the high-priced fonts out there.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>The Pattern Library</strong> - <a href="http://thepatternlibrary.com/">thepatternlibrary.com</a>
          <br>This on going project compiles patterns shared by the most talented designers out there for you to use freely in your designs.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>

      I hope you might find some of them useful. The cover image is one of my <a href="http://instagram.com/chirpysnail">Instagram</a> shots from last month. Enjoy the April weather!
