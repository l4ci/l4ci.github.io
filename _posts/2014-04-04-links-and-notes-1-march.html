      <h2>Notes</h2>
      <p>
        Hey there, unfortunately I didn't find any time to blog lately. Which is a good sign in one way, because it means I'm busy with work for different projects. But nevertheless I would love to write more. This post should evolve to a habit of posting small updates (that are too long for a <a href="https://twitter.com/{{site.me.twitter}}">tweet</a>) and interesting links I stumbled upon. So here are my notes and links for march.
      </p>

      <h2>Links</h2>
      <p>
        Links to various interesting / creative / new stuff on the web I came across last month.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>Uinames.com</strong> - <a href="http://uinames.com/">uinames.com</a>
            <br>If you need realistic sounding names for designing a user profile page or some sort of timeline.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>Uifaces.com</strong> - <a href="http://uifaces.com/">uifaces.com</a>
            <br>If you need realistic photos you can use in mockups and even show to your client. No more fake model photos or empty faces.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>Responsive Table</strong> - <a href="http://codepen.io/geoffyuen/pen/FCBEg">codepen.io/geoffyuen/pen/FCBEg</a>
            <br>We are used to design everything responsive nowadays - there are only a few things missing: responsive images and tables. This codepen shows an interesting method for making a table usable on small screen sizes.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>Gibson Font</strong> - <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/canadatype/gibson/">myfonts.com/fonts/canadatype/gibson</a>
            <br>A nice sans serif typeface, that could be an alternative to some of the high-priced fonts out there.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>The Pattern Library</strong> - <a href="http://thepatternlibrary.com/">thepatternlibrary.com</a>
            <br>This on going project compiles patterns shared by the most talented designers out there for you to use freely in your designs.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
