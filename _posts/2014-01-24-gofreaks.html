excerpt:    Websites for gaming communities tend to be looking like from the past. I tried to change that with my recent project for the german multigaming clan gofreaks.eu.

        When I created the first homepage for the <a href="http://gofreaks.eu">gofreaks.eu</a> clan, it was only meant to be a simple page for presenting it to the outside world. The whole organisation and communication was arranged in facebook: A main facebook group for clannews, organisation, game related talk and member communication.
      </p>
      <p>
        This worked out for quite some time, but lately they struggeld to keep up with all the new members. The main group exploded and it was very hard to keep up with all the information that got posted. They started to create more groups for all the different games, but that created an invisible wall between the clan members. So something new had to be done...

      <p>
        I started to develop a new site. A place, where every member can interact with others and also get all the related information for his games without distraction. A place where you could easily get information, like his steam or esl name, about another member without asking them directly.

        Since facebook was always the main plattform for the clan, I integrated the login/registration process directly with facebook. So anyone who was already in the clan (and so in facebook) could easily register on the page without creating a user account manually.

      <p>Every member has a profil page, where he/she can enter all the related information about him/herself. Things like Steam, Origin, Battle.net account information, but also links to twitch.tv, esl and facebook.</p>

      I also wanted to give them the option to make all these (quite sensible) information available to members only. So there is the option to do exactly that. Guest only see the avatar and nickname, when a profil is privat.

      <p>
        That is one of the keypoints that had the be solved. A forum is always a nice idea, but with all the different games this wasnÂ´t enough. For this reason I added a new functionality to the site, which is quite unique.
      </p>
      <p>
        There is a list of games on the site, that continuosly grows. Every member can join a game and by doing that some things happen:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>The member is listed under the game</li>
        <li>The game gets listed on the members profil</li>
        <li>The gameleader is notified</li>
        <li>The member gets access to the game related forums</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        The last point is the most important one. With this process it was ensured, that every member only gets the information related to his game. There were some fights about this, because some people got annoyed on how others talk about their game in the old facebook groups.
      </p>
      <h3>Forum</h3>
      <img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/img/gofreaks/forum_view.png" alt="Forum View">
      <p>
        So the forum is the main communication tool now, where game related talk is only available to those interested in them and all the other clan related information is available at all times.

      <h2>Notifications</h2>
      <p>
        After testing the site with some members the most asked feature was a notification system. As everyone was used to from facebook, you get a notification when something happens that is related to you.
      </p>
      <p>Therefore I developed the so called <code>INS</code> Instant Notification System. It tracks every activity on the site, and notifies the right members of new updates everytime. It even works without refreshing the page.</p>

        Although this step is not 100% finished yet (as the whole site is still in beta), the page is fully responsive. That means it not only looks good on any screen device, its also fully functional. In other words, members can read and post in the forum or read other news on the site, when visiting the page from their mobile device.
